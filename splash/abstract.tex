\begin{abstract}
  Type systems are important tools to ensure partial correctness of
  programs, to establish abstractions and to guide the programmer in
  the development process. However, there is currently a lack of
  established tools supporting the development of type systems, as
  there are for lexers and parsers. We introduce a declarative
  specification language for type systems, that allows to type systems
  in a natural deduction style. Two results are generated from those
  specifications. A first-order formula representation to facilitate
  the use of automated theorem provers and an efficient type
  checker. Both results aim to support a faster development cycle for
  type systems.
