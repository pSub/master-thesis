Type systems are important tools to detect semantic inconsistencies,
to establish abstractions and to guide the programmer in the
development process. However, there is currently a lack of established
tools supporting the development of type systems. Tools like lexer and
parser generators. We introduce a declarative specification language
for type systems, that allows to specify type systems in a natural
deductive style. We generate two products from a specification: A
first-order formula representation to facilitate the use of automated
theorem provers and a type checker. The type checker generator uses
results proven by automated theorem provers to check the applicability
of optimization strategies. Both results aim to make the development
cycle for type systems faster and to narrow the gap between theory and
practice.
