Type systems are important tools to detect semantic inconsistencies,
to establish abstractions and to guide programmers in the development
process. However, there is currently a lack of established tools
supporting the development of type systems, tools like lexer and
parser generators but for type systems. We introduce a declarative
specification language for type systems that allows to specify type
systems in a natural deductive style. We generate two products out of
a type system specification: A first-order formula representation to
facilitate the use of automated theorem provers and a type
checker. The type checker generator uses results proven by automated
theorem provers to check the applicability of optimization strategies
and the first-order formula representation is also a reference
implementation. Both results aim to accelerate the development cycle
for type systems and to narrow the gap between theory and practice.
