\section{Translations}
For the generation of first-order formulas not all sections of a
specification are important. The section that declares the
meta-variables and the section that declares the judgments are not
used directly at all. With regard to formula generation they are only
used to ensure correct syntax.

\todo[inline]{Implement imports and describe how they are handled.}

Environments declarations are translated in a uniform way. For every
environment two formulas are generated. These two formulas handle the
look-up of entries in the environment. One formula for the base case
and one for the step case of the lookup.

\begin{multline}
  \forall e, x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_m . \\ (lookup_e(x_1,\dots,x_n,y_1,\dots,y_m, bind(x_1,\dots,x_n,y_1,\dots,y_m,e)))
\end{multline}

The above formula represents the base case of environment
look-ups. All non-terminals in the environment definition tagged with
input are translated into variables $x_1 \dots x_n$ and all tagged
with output are translated into variables $y_1 \dots y_m$
respectively. The variable $e$ ranges over all possible
environments. The $bind$ predicate used in this formula allows to add
new input/output pairs to the environment. In the implementation the
order of arguments is a bit different, but this difference is for the
discussion of the concept negligible. For details see the next
section.\todo{Use a reference} The predicate $lookup$ that is defined
also takes input/output pairs and an environment. In the base case the
environment given to $lookup$ contains the input/output pairs of
$lookup$ directly. Therefore those are trivially contained in the
environment.

\todo[inline]{Format look-up step formula nicely.}
\begin{multline}
  \forall e, x_1, \dots, x_n, x_1', \dots, x_n', y_1, \dots, y_m, y_1', \dots,
  y_m' . \\
  (lookup(x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_m, e) \implies \\ lookup(x_1,
  \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_m, bind(x_1',\dots,x_n',y_1',\dots,y_m',e))
\end{multline}

This formula represents the step case of environment look-ups. Its
intuition is that if some input/output pair is contained in an
environment $e$ the it is also contained in an environment in which a,
possibly different, input/output pair is stored. Variables $x_i$ and
$x_i'$ are non-terminals from the environment declaration tagged with
input, $y_i$ and $y_i'$ are non-terminals tagged with output
respectively.

The AST nodes of the programming language are translated into
predicates. To help theorem provers for each of those predicates an
axiom for injectivity and univalence is created. Those hold by
definition of the AST nodes.

The most important part is the translation of the typing
rules. Depending on whether the typing rules has premises either of
the following schema is used:

\begin{align}
  \forall FV(c) &. c \\
  \forall FV(p_1,\dots, p_n) &. p_1 \land \dots \land p_n \implies c
\end{align}
