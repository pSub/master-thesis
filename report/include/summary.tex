\subsubsection{JavaCOP: Declarative Pluggable Types for Java}
JavaCOP \cite{Markstrum:2010:JDP:1667048.1667049} is a framework for
pluggable type systems in Java. It hooks directly into \verb|javac|
and therefore integrates nicely into the normal development cycle. It
provides three tools. A declarative language to describe structural
constraints on the AST of Java programs in a flow-insensitive
manner, an API is provided to use the declarative language for
flow-sensitive data flow analysis and a test harness is provided which
helps to test that a program that is well-typed actually satisfies the
invariants of the type system. In contrast to~\cite{bergan2007typmix}
the syntax of Java cannot be extended.

\subsubsection{A Generator for Type Checkers}
Gast introduces in~\cite{gast2005generator} a type checker generator
that can produce from declarative type system specifications type
checkers for functional as well as imperative and object-oriented
programming languages. Type checking is done by a specialized proof
search, which is based on unification and backtracking. A
distinguishing feature of Gasts work is the possibility to annotate
the typing rules with optimizations. For example it is possible to
reuse (potentially incomplete) proofs using subproof extraction. Gast
also provides a formal foundation for his proof search. However the
resulting type checkers do not report specialized error messages on
ill-typed  programs.

\subsubsection{Automatic Generation of Object-Oriented Type Checkers}
Ortin et al.\ present in~\cite{ortin2014automatic} the framework TyS
for the implementation of type checkers for object-oriented
programming languages. TyS provides a type checker constructor TyCC
which produces a type checker given a file that specifies the types
together with the subtyping relation and operations on these
types. Operations on types correspond to typing rules and are
implemented using an API that is provided by TyS. Currently only Java
is supported for the implementation of the operations and the addition
of new languages requires the replication of the API in that
language.

TyS can be used in conjunction with different parser generator tools
and has been tested with flex, bison, yacc and ANTLR. It does support
the generation of static and dynamic type checkers and was applied
(among others) to the object-oriented language Drill and the
imperative language Frog. TyS does not support polymorphic types.

In contrast to the present work the TyS framework does not provide a
high-level specification language in favor of readable generated code
and is tied to object oriented languages. It however delivers a tool
that has been successfully integrated in existing tool chains.
\subsubsection{Typmix: A Framework for Implementing Modular Extensible Type
  Systems}
Typmix~\cite{bergan2007typmix} is a framework for implementing type
systems in for the extensible compiler xoc. Although type systems can
be implemented in xoc directly, the author claims that they are often
verbose and contain redundancies. Type system specifications in Typmix
are written in two languages. One describes the context modifications,
they are called scoperules. The other describes typing rules using
premisses and conclusions. The contexts in the typing rules are
referred to as \verb|Env| and one concrete context as
\verb|Env.Ctx|. This separation of concerns increases modularity,
e.g.\ adding a context to a judgment requires only changes were it is
actually used. Typmix used to implement a type system for an ML-like
language and for FeatherweightJava.

As typmix is integrated in an extensible compiler, its focus is on
extending type systems. Although the scope and type language are
declarative it has no interface to proof assistants.

\subsubsection{Automatic Type Inference via Partial Evaluation}
Tomb and Flanagan~\cite{tomb2005automatic} use Prolog to implement
type inference. If typing rules are syntax directed Prolog can type
check a program efficiently. A Prolog type checker can be easily
changed to infer types by leaving type variables unbound. However this
can easily diverge due to Prologs depth-first search. This
inefficiency is solved in~\cite{tomb2005automatic} by a two phase
approach. In the first phase some Prolog clauses are evaluated, which
is determined by a partitioning parameter. This parameter is usually
set such that relations that depend on types associated with type
variables are delayed into the second phase. These two phases resemble
a constraint generation and constraint solving phase. The result of
the first phase may contain arbitrary Prolog terms, but the authors
claim that for common cases, the result is simple and can be
efficiently solved by e.g. Datalog. This approach also applies to
non-syntax directed typing rules but might be less efficient.

Just as the present work~\cite{tomb2005automatic} generates from a
high-level specification a two-phase constraint-based type inference
system. The advantage of choosing a logic language like Prolog is that
the correctness of the type inference algorithms follows from the
correctness of the partial evaluator. However the current approach
does only works for language definitions in Prolog and does not
attempt to reduce the non-determinism that is introduced from
non-syntax directed rules.
